# Country Happiness Data RESTFUL API

These are bare-bones intructions on how to CRUD the data

The entire application is contained within the `app.rb` file.

`config.ru` is a minimal Rack configuration for unicorn.

`run-tests.sh` runs a simplistic test and generates the API
documentation below.

It uses `run-curl-tests.rb` which runs each command defined in
`commands.yml`.

## Install

    bundle install

## Run the app

    unicorn -p 7000

## Run the tests

    ./run-tests.sh
